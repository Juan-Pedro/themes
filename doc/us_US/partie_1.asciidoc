To understand the plugin we will develop in this part a theme as simple as possible, using the least possible options. To begin, let's define the nature of our project:

* We will adopt the horizontal size pad (default settings).
* The menu bar will be located in High (default settings).
* Barre d'état apparente (paramètres par défaut).
* Tray visible (default settings).
* The design will include three parts composed as: Ground floor (Living room, Kitchen), Bedroom.
* Single frame (default settings).
* We configure style with a border and a shadow for rendering.

We will start by creating a theme, click on image:ajout.png[role="img-thumbnail"]. Change the title to a welcome message, replace in the first popover +menu+ by +Welcome to Our Home automation space+. The theme that we want to create and practically, they we remain more than to configure <<ajoutedition,buttons>> and <<popover_de_style,style>>. +
Click image:popovemenu8.png[role="img-thumbnail"] and press image:plus.png[role="img-thumbnail"] to create a new button. +

[role="col-md-8 text-justify"]
Our first button is a submenu, enter +Ground floor+ in the field Name and click submenu to display the sub-entries, click image:plus.png[role="img-thumbnail"] to add another sub-entry, fill each entry with +Living room+ and +Kitchen+ and validate our first button is created.

[role="row"]
{nbsp} +

The second button is simpler, enter +Bedroom+ in the field name and validate. +
 
[role="row"]
{nbsp} +

[role="col-md-4"]
image:styledemo.png[role="img-thumbnail"]
[role="col-md-8 text-justify"]
--
Now that our buttons are created , we will apply a style for a better visual , here everyone does what he wants, for our demo I chose the following parameters :

* Border : *Size*: +5+, *Radius*: +5+, *Style*: +groove+, *Color*: +Blue+
* Shadow : *Size*: +10+, +10+, +10+, *Color*: +Bleu Clair+

Save your theme now. +

This button will create the Design mode pages , the main page to the theme format and subpages to the main frame format. Each time you load a theme, plugin verified that the pages are created, if all pages are available the button will be disable. He can enable the button easily just change the size of the main window. The button is enable as soon as one adds a button.

[IMPORTANT]
On first use, the plugin retrieves the IDs of pages to update the theme, it is essential to save immediatly to not lose data.

[icon="../images/tip.png"]

===== Bootstrap

[role="col-md-4"]

[role="col-md-8 text-justify"]

Get to that stage all pages must be created, this button will allow injected code on the main page to manage all your design after all modifications, click on this button to update the main window. +

==== Secondaries Pages management

[role="col-md-4"]
image:secondaires.png[role="img-thumbnail"]
[role="col-md-8 text-justify"]
--
The plugin was to stop the creation of the main page, other pages and the injection of bootstrap code on the main page, but it appeared important to manage secondary pages from the plugin also able to control operation. +
The images to be used for secondary pages will be added to the <<gestionnaire_d_8217_images,Image Manager>> for our theme will be the format of our main framework will be created using the software link:http://www.sweethome3d.com/fr/[SweetHome 3D] or other software of your choice. +
{nbsp} +
--

[role="col-md-12 text-justify"]
--

This chapter aims to show how to set up a secondary page, the button image:bajouter.png[role="img-thumbnail"] is disable because we are in +single-frame+ configuration +multi-frame+ is identical except you can create as many frame as you want. +
We take care of all the parts, we will discuss the page *General* later since it occupies a special role. +
For the rest of the project, we will establish the various modules in each room:

* *Living room*: 1 presence sensor, 1 light, 1 thermostat, Network Monitoring
* *Kitchen*: 1 presence sensor, 1 light
* *Bedroom*: 1 presence sensor, 1 light, 1 thermostat

Start by selecting +Living room+ in the selector *Pages* +
If you click on the frame, a popover to the frame configuration appears:
Commençons par sélectionner +Salon+ dans le sélecteur *Pages* +
Si vous cliquez sur le cadre, un popover pour la configuration du cadre apparaît. +
 +
Change +Title+ by +Living room+, and select the downloaded image with the selector *Image*. For the full operation of the popover view <<popover_des_cadres,Popover Frames>>
Simply save, and use the button image:bbootstrap.png[role="img-thumbnail"] to update the secondary page _Salon_ in Design mode, the last step is to place the widgets in the Design View . Repeat these steps for the other two room. +

===== Home Page

[role="col-md-12 text-justify"]
--
This page will serve as a home page for our design mode, it will be to centralize information or simply show a picture of your house in 3D, it remains free to your imagination. In our case we are going to various informations :

===== SVG lines

[role="col-md-12 text-justify"]
--

Although at this stage your design is functional, it seemed interesting to me to provide a system that would locate in the room where is your widget (or virtual, etc ...), and it is natural that i've implemented the *lines SVG*. From <<popover_des_cadres,Popover  Frames>>, click Image:plusb.png[role="img-thumbnail"] anew *SVG line* will appear at the top right of your frame and a new popover is available. +
{nbsp} +
--

[role="col-md-4"]
image:popoversvg.png[role="img-thumbnail"]
[role="col-md-8 text-justify"]
--

This popover will serve you to move the *SVG line* to the desired location, *line SVG* is composed of four parts, a small rectangle called +Start+, a line called +First Part+, a line called + Second Part+ and last rectangle called +End+. +
The D-Pad is used to move the line, the middle button to validate, Image:trash.png[role="img-thumbnail"] at the top right of the popover remove the SVG line. Just select the parts of the SVG line you want to move and use the D-Pad. The last switch is used to change the color of the line SVG, they correspond to different categories of *_Jeedom_*(TM). +

==== Conclusion

[role="col-md-12 text-justify"]

Your theme and your design are finalized. You may very well add it to your profile *_Jeedom _*(TM) for direct access.

[icon="tip.png"]
[TIP]
It is possible to create profiles 'guest', simply for the profile *_Jeedom _*(TM) to point to the desired room instead of the main page, which will allow the guest to access all functions of the room without access to the menu bar and other secondary pages. +
